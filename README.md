# Secure Set MT4 Trading Bot

## Description
This code represents the Secure Set MT4 Trading Bot, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The Secure Set MT4 Trading Bot is designed for high-volatility trend trading in the Forex market. It allows users to set their desired stop loss and take profit levels, and also includes features like trailing stop and virtual stop loss/take profit.

## How It Works
The code is written in MQL4, the programming language used for developing trading robots in the MetaTrader 4 platform. It consists of several functions that perform specific tasks related to trade initiation, management, and conclusion.

### Variables
- `StopLoss`: Specifies the default stop loss value for trades.
- `TakeProfit`: Specifies the default take profit value for trades.

### Functions
1. `OpenTrade(double price, double stopLoss, double takeProfit)`: Initiates a trade at the specified price with the given stop loss and take profit levels. It uses the `OrderSend` function to place the trade order and assigns a unique magic number to identify the trade.
2. `TrailingStop()`: Enables trailing stop for the active trades. It uses the `OrderSelect` function to iterate through all the trades and checks if the trade type is either buy or sell. It then calculates the trailing stop level based on the current market conditions using the `MarketInfo` function and modifies the trade's stop loss level using the `OrderModify` function.
3. `CloseTrade(int ticket)`: Closes the trade with the specified ticket number. It uses the `OrderClose` function to close the trade at the current bid price.
4. `VirtualStopLossTakeProfit()`: Works with virtual stop loss and take profit levels based on the current market conditions. It calculates the virtual stop loss and take profit levels using the bid and ask prices and the specified stop loss and take profit values. It then modifies the trade's stop loss and take profit levels using the `OrderModify` function.
5. `OptimizeForHighVolatility()`: Optimizes the code specifically for high-volatility forex pairs. This function is a placeholder and can be customized based on specific optimization techniques for high-volatility trading.

### Entry Point
The `OnStart` function is the entry point of the program. It is executed when the program starts or when a new tick arrives. In this function, the trailing stop is enabled for both pending and real orders using the `TrailingStop` function. Then, the stop loss and take profit levels are set separately for each order type (buy or sell) using the `OrderModify` function. The virtual stop loss and take profit levels are calculated and set using the `VirtualStopLossTakeProfit` function. The code is also optimized for high-volatility forex pairs using the `OptimizeForHighVolatility` function. Finally, the trade is closed using the `CloseTrade` function with the specified ticket number.
